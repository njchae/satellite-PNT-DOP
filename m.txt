I ordered a PS5 a while ago and it was lost by UPS, I filed a claim with them, and they resolved it saying they lost it. They said they would forward the information to the sender, and then I could communicate with them. However, when I contacted Playstation support, they said that UPS is sending a package back, and they can't do anything until it arrives. I need someone at Playstation to communicate with UPS to get this resolved, because UPS is not going to be sending anything back, that is an error. I contacted UPS and they said that there is nothing they can do unless the sender contacts them.
